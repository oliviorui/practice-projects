## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project taught me the importance of layout consistency with **Flexbox** and the effective use of custom fonts. I also worked on creating clean hover effects for interactive elements like the blog title:

```css
h1:hover { 
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to experiment more with **CSS Grid** for layout control and improve my understanding of accessibility practices for creating better user experiences.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me with Flexbox layout for this project.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS hover effect](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) - Gave me a better understanding of how to implement hover effects in a clean way.
