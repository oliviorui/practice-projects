## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I practiced working with **Flexbox** to structure the layout and **CSS custom properties** to maintain consistent styling. One of the things I implemented was a hover effect that adds a subtle transformation:

```css
.anime:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    transition: 0.5s;
    border-radius: 25px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on improving responsiveness using **CSS Grid** and experimenting with **SASS** to make styling more scalable.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped in structuring the layout effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs - CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) - Used for smooth hover effects.
